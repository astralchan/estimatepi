# About
This program estimates pi by assigning random points on a square with a circle inscribed, then uses the proportion of the number of points within the circle versus out for a certain amount of iterations. The more iterations, the more likely it is to be accurate.

# Dependencies
In order to build estimatepi, the following dependencies are needed:

* Standard C "math.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, time.h" library headers
* A C compiler (e.g. gcc, tcc, clang, etc)
* Make
* (optional) man to see documentation

# Configuration
To edit the number of iterations, edit src/config.h.

# Building
Configure config.mk to set your C compiler. Then to build this program locally, simply run
```
make
```
The program will be contained within a new folder "bin." To run it, simply run
```
./bin/estimatepi
```
To clean the source directory, simply run
```
make clean
```

# Installing
For installation instructions, see INSTALL.md

# Running
Once installed, estimatepi can be ran simply by running
```
estimatepi
```

# Documentation
Once installed, the man page can be accessed simply by running
```
man estimatepi
```
